# VTBili Schedule API and Webserver
A wrapper around BiliBili Calendar (Scheduling system) into a readable API.<br>
(Oh, also some Youtube channels, I guess)


Still WIP!

**Currently running on:** [api.ihateani.me](https://api.ihateani.me)

## Setup
1. Install MongoDB on your server
2. Modify `init_db.py` `MONGODB_URL` variable to your IP and PORT
3. Execute `init_db.py` to populate your DB.

If you want different DB Name, you can change it too!
