## VTBili Schedule API and Webserver

A wrapper around BiliBili Calendar (Scheduling system) into a readable API.<br>
*(Oh, also some Youtube channels, I guess)*

**Version**: 0.9.0

Still WIP!

~~**Currently running on:** [api.ihateani.me](https://api.ihateani.me)~~

### Setup
1. Install MongoDB on your server
2. Modify `init_db.py` `MONGODB_URL` variable to your IP and PORT
3. Execute `init_db.py` to populate your DB.

If you want different DB Name, you can change it too!

*tbh, I didn't really think this setup would work, but good luck figuring it out*
